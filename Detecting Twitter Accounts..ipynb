    "Besides being used by genuine users, Twitter is home to an ample amount of automated programs, which are also known as Twitter bots. Some Twitter bots exploit Twitter features to pursue malicious goals such as election interference and extreme propaganda. Twitter bots co-exist with human users on Twitter and they hide their automated nature by imitating genuine users. Since identifying bots in social media is crucial to preserving the integrity of the online discourse and these proposals are generally supervised, many research efforts have been devoted to the creation of relevant datasets.\n",

    "A Twitter bot is a type of bot software that controls a Twitter account via the Twitter API.[1] The bot software may autonomously perform actions such as tweeting, re-tweeting, liking, following, unfollowing, or direct messaging other accounts. The automation of Twitter accounts is governed by a set of automation rules that outline proper and improper uses of automation.\n",
    "In 2009, Twitter bots were estimated to create approximately 24% of tweets on Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter bots, also known as zombies, are automated Twitter accounts controlled by bot software. While they are programmed to perform tasks that resemble those of everyday Twitter users — such as liking tweets and following other users — their purpose is to tweet and retweet content for specific goals on a large scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the bot and its activity can be helpful or harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter bots can be used for helpful purposes, such as broadcasting important content like weather emergencies in real time, sharing informative content en masse, and generating automatic replies via direct messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter bots also can be designed for the malicious purposes of platform intimidation and manipulation — like spreading fake news campaigns, spamming, violating others’ privacy, and sock-puppeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder if one account can cause damage. It usually takes a larger effort. Twitter bots are often part of what’s known as a botnet. A botnet is a broad network of automated accounts that work together to appear legitimate, liking and following each other as if they were real. Worth noting: Bots also operate on other social media platforms.\n",
